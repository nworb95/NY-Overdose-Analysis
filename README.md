# "Overdose" Analysis Framework

My idea is for this to become a stencil I draw my ad-hoc analyses into. 
Inputs include public data source APIs to hit, and outputs will UI/
visualization components.   My hope is that this framework continues to 
evolve with my skills, and that it will be a continued lesson in good 
coding practices.
